## About
PinMyLocation is a Web Application developed for my portfolio that allows users to save there current location as a pin on the map. The Pin stores the users current location, the date the user created the pin, and a name. A map is a collection of pins created by the user and can optionally be shared publically to anyone who has the link to the map. Public maps shared with a link do not require a user account to view.

## Tech Stack
 - Next.JS (Javascript app router)
 - Tailwind CSS
 - Prisma (Postgresql)
 - Auth0
 - HTML/CSS/JS
 - Production deployed on Vercel
